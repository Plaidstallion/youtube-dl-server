this is a temporary readme, maybe dont readme yet.

advantages:
    can work fully offline:
        original webpage had:
            <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
            <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-ZMP7rVo3mIykV+2+9J3UJ46jBk0WLaUAdn689aCwoqbBJiSnjAK/l8WvCWPIPm49" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
            <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-ChfqqxuZUCnJSK3+MXmPNIyE6ZbWh2IMqE241rYiqJxyMiZ6OW/JmZQ5stwEULTy" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
            which means that it wouldnt work offline
        now the current one has everything locally stored
        show example of firefox network tab with the old version and the new version showing how the new version is only localhost as opposed to the old one being internet based
    better path names:
        /q has been changed to /queue to avoid confusion on what the heck q means

todo:
    add a way to specify which directory the video will download to
    add authentication via google authenticator
